On the other hand the followers of Theodorus and of Nestorius rejoicing in the division of the natures, have taught only a relative union. Meanwhile the Holy Church of God , condemning equally the impiety of both sorts of heresies , recognises the union of God the Word with the flesh synthetically, that is to say, hypostatically. For in the mystery of Christ the synthetical union not only preserves unconfusedly the natures which are united, but also allows no separation."

He likewise has said that the profession of faith made by Thomas when he had, after the resurrection, touched the hands and the side of the Lord, viz.:My Lord and my God ,was not said in reference to Christ , but that Thomas, filled with wonder at the miracle of the resurrection, thus thanked God who had raised up Christ.
