Therefore Moses , the prophet of God , speaks after this manner:To them nothing is to be added, and from them nothing is to be taken away.And the divine Apostle glorying in them cries out,which things the angels desire to look into,and,if an angel preach to you anything besides that which you have received, let him be anathema .Seeing these things are so, being thus well-testified unto us, we rejoice over them as he that has found great spoil, and press to our bosom with gladness the divine canons, holding fast all the precepts of the same, complete and without change, whether they have been set forth by the holy trumpets of the Spirit , the renowned Apostles, or by the Six Ecumenical Councils, or by Councils locally assembled for promulgating the decrees of the said Ecumenical Councils, or by our holy Fathers. For all these, being illumined by the same Spirit, defined such things as were expedient. Accordingly those whom they placed under anathema , we likewise anathematize ; those whom they deposed, we also depose; those whom they excommunicated , we also excommunicate; and those whom they delivered over to punishment, we subject to the same penalty. And nowlet your conversation be without covetousness ,cries out Paul the divine Apostle, who was caught up into the third heaven and heard unspeakable words."

Therefore we decree, that every one who is raised to the rank of the episcopate shall know the psalter by heart, so that from it he may admonish and instruct all the clergy who are subject to him. And diligent examination shall be made by the metropolitan whether he be zealously inclined to read diligently, and not merely now and then, the sacred canons, the holy  Gospel , and the book of the divine Apostle, and all other divine Scripture ; and whether he lives according to God's commandments, and also teaches the same to his people. For the special treasure (\u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u1f77\u03b1) of our high priesthood is the oracles which have been divinely delivered to us, that is the true science of the Divine Scriptures , as says Dionysius the Great. And if his mind be not set, and even glad, so to do and teach, let him not be ordained. For says God by the prophet ,You have rejected knowledge , I will also reject you, that you shall be no priest to me."

Therefore we being taught by him do decree, that under no circumstances, shall a Bishop for the sake of filthy lucre invent feigned excuses for sins , and exact gold or silver or other gifts from the bishops , clergy , or monks who are subject to him. For says the Apostle,The unrighteous shall not possess the kingdom of God ,and,The children ought not to lay up for the parents , but the parents for the children.If then any is found, who for the sake of exacting gold or any other gift, or who from personal feeling, has suspended from the ministry, or even excommunicated , any of the clergy subject to his jurisdiction, or who has closed any of the venerable temples, so that the service of God may not be celebrated in it, pouring out his madness even upon things insensible, and thus showing himself to be without understanding, he shall be subjected to the same punishment he devised for others, and his trouble shall return on his own head, as a transgressor of God's commandment and of the apostolic precepts.

The Lord God is not found among such, unless, perchance, having been humbled by their own fall, they return to a sober mind. It behooves them the rather to turn to God with a contrite heart and to pray for forgiveness and pardon of so grave a sin , and no longer to boast in an unholy gift. For the Lord is near unto them that are of a contrite heart. With regard, therefore, to those who pride themselves that because of their benefactions of gold they were ordained in the Church , and resting confidently in this evil custom (so alien from God and inconsistent with the whole priesthood ), with a proud look and open mouth vilify with abusive words those who on account of the strictness of their life were chosen by the Holy Ghost and have been ordained without any gift of money, we decree in the first place that they take the lowest place in their order; but if they do not amend let them be subjected to a fine. But if it appear that any one has done this [i.e., given money], at any time as a price for ordination, let him be dealt with according to the Apostolic Canon which says:If a bishop has obtained possession of his dignity by means of money (the same rule applies also to a presbyter or deacon ) let him be deposed and also the one who ordained him, and let him also be altogether cut off from communion, even as Simon Magus was by me Peter.To the same effect is the second canon of our holy fathers of Chalcedon, which says: If any bishop gives ordination in return for money, and puts up for sale that which cannot be sold, and ordains for money a bishop or chorepiscopus , or presbyter , or deacon , or any other of those who are reckoned among the clergy ; or who for money shall appoint anyone to the office of \u0153conomus , advocate, or paramonarius; or, in a word, who has done anything else contrary to the canon, for the sake of filthy lucre \u2014 he who has undertaken to do anything of this sort, having been convicted, shall be in danger of losing his degree. And he who has been ordained shall derive no advantage from the ordination or promotion thus negotiated; but let him remain a stranger to the dignity and responsibility which he attained by means of money.

This canon we now renew. And if any prince be found hindering this being carried out, let him be excommunicated . But if any of the metropolitans shall take no care that this be done, he being free from constraint or fear or other reasonable excuse, let him be subjected to the canonical penalties. While the council is engaged in considering the canons or matters which have regard to the Gospel , it behooves the assembled Bishops, with all attention and grave thought to guard the divine and life-giving commandments of God , for in keeping of them there is great reward; because our lamp is the commandment, and our light is the law, and trial and discipline are the way of life, and the commandment of the Lord shining afar gives light to the eyes. It is not permitted to a metropolitan to demand any of those things which the bishops bring with them, whether it be a horse or any other gift.
