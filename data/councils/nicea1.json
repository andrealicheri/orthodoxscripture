For to the catechumen himself there is need of time and of a longer trial after baptism . For the apostolic saying is clear,Not a novice; lest, being lifted up with pride , he fall into condemnation and the snare of the devil .But if, as time goes on, any sensual sin should be found out about the person, and he should be convicted by two or three witnesses, let him cease from the clerical office.
