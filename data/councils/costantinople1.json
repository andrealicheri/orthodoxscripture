And let not bishops go beyond their dioceses for ordination or any other ecclesiastical ministrations, unless they be invited. And the aforesaid canon concerning dioceses being observed, it is evident that the synod of every province will administer the affairs of that particular province as was decreed at Nice. But the Churches of God in heathen nations must be governed according to the custom which has prevailed from the times of the Fathers."

Thereupon, they are first sealed or anointed with the holy oil upon the forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, and ears; and when we seal them, we say,The Seal of the gift of the Holy Ghost .But Eunomians, who are baptized with only one immersion, and Montanists , who are here called Phrygians, and Sabellians, who teach the identity of Father and Son, and do sundry other mischievous things, and [the partisans of] all other heresies \u2014 for there are many such here, particularly among those who come from the country of the Galatians:\u2014 all these, when they desire to turn to orthodoxy , we receive as heathen . On the first day we make them Christians ; on the second, catechumens ; on the third, we exorcise them by breathing thrice in their face and ears; and thus we instruct them and oblige them to spend some time in the Church , and to hear the Scriptures ; and then we baptize them."
