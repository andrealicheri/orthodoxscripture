Let no bishop be allowed to transfer from a small city to a different one: as there is an obvious reason for this fault, accounting for such attempts; since no bishop could ever yet be found who endeavoured to be translated from a larger city to a smaller one. It is therefore evident that such persons are inflamed with excessive covetousness and are only serving ambition in order to have the repute of possessing greater authority. Is it then the pleasure of all that so grave an abuse be punished with great severity? For I think that men of this sort should not be admitted even to lay communion. All the bishops said: It is the pleasure of all."

I think then that practices and devices of such sort absolutely must be punished, so that a man of this kind be deemed unworthy even of lay communionin extremis. Therefore make answer whether this sentence is approved by you. They [the bishops ] answered: What has been said is approved of."

And if any one require that his case be heard yet again, and at his request it seem good to move the bishop of Rome to send presbyters a latere, let it be in the power of that bishop , according as he judges it to be good and decides it to be right \u2014 that some be sent to be judges with the bishops and invested with his authority by whom they were sent.

I think that it is well to await his [the absent bishop's ] arrival also. But if after summons by letter he does not come, nor even write in reply, the wish of the people ought to be complied with."

For many of the bishops do not intermit resorting to the imperial Court, especially the Africans, who, as we have learned from our beloved brother and fellow bishop , Gratus, do not accept salutary counsels, but so despise them that one man carries to the Court petitions many and diverse and of no possible benefit to the Church , and does not (as ought to be done and as is fitting) assist and help the poor and the laity or the widows , but is intriguing to obtain worldly dignities and offices for certain persons . This evil then causes enfeeblement [better, murmuring (read\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u1f79\u03bdor\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u1f79\u03bd)], not without some scandal and blame to us.

You should consider with all thoroughness and care, that if some rich man or professional advocate be desired for bishop , he be not ordained until he have fulfilled the ministry of reader, deacon , and presbyter , in order that, passing by promotion through the several grades, he may advance (if, that is, he be found worthy) to the height of the episcopate . And he shall remain in each order assuredly for no brief time, that so his faith , his reputable life, his steadfastness of character and considerateness of demeanour may be well-known, and that he, being deemed worthy of the divine sacerdotal office [sacerdotium, i.e., the episcopate ] may enjoy the highest honour . For it is not fitting, nor does discipline or good conversation allow to proceed to this act rashly or lightly, so as to ordain a bishop or presbyter or deacon hastily; as thus he would rightly be accounted a novice, especially since also the most blessed Apostle, he who was the teacher of the Gentiles , is seen to have forbidden hasty ordinations; for the test of [even] the longest period will not unreasonably be required to exemplify the conversation and character of each [candidate]."

A definite limit of time should therefore be set in such a case, especially since not to receive a bishop is accounted the part of rude and discourteous persons . You remember that in former times our fathers decreed that if a layman were staying in a city and should not come to divine worship for three [successive] Sundays [that is], for three [full] weeks, he should be repelled from communion. If then this has been decreed in the case of laymen , it is neither needful, nor fitting, nor yet even expedient that a bishop , unless he has some grave necessity or difficult business, should be very long absent from his own church and distress the people committed to him."

Some of our brethren and fellow bishops are known to possess very little private property in the cities in which they are placed as bishops , but have great possessions in other places, with which they are, moreover, able to help the poor. I think then permission should be given them, if they are to visit their estates and attend to the gathering of the harvest, to pass three Sundays, that is, to stay for three weeks, on their estates, and to assist at divine worship and celebrate the liturgy in the nearest church in which a presbyter holds service, in order that they may not be seen to be absent from worship, and in order that they may not come too frequently to the city in which there is a bishop . In this way their private affairs will suffer no loss from their absence and they will be seen to be clear from the charge of ambition and arrogance."
