For if to the\n \nclergy\n \nwho voluntarily offered themselves to the contest of confession, and who, when tormented, failed in constancy and yielded, and afterwards returned to the contest, if to them indulgence is scarcely granted, because they deferred to execute their ministerial duties; nor, in the opinion of this divine father, is anything else objected to them but that they deserted the brethren, when in adverse and turbulent times they might have been useful in confirming them in the\n \nfaith\n \n, and that after that they had been counted worthy to bear testimony to the\n \nfaith\n \n, and carried about in their flesh shall that chief\n \npriest\n \nand the marks of Christ; how pastor, who ought to lay down his life for the sheep, when he has deserted the flock that was committed unto him, and repudiated its care and administration, and as far as in him lies given it over to the wolf, be thought worthy to retain the dignity of the sacred ministry, and not rather be judged worthy of the severest punish-meats for deserting the people entrusted to his care? Nay, but he will demand a reward for this thing, or rather he will himself supply it to himself: refusing that which brings labour to them, namely, the office of teaching and of correcting\n \nvice\n \n; but embracing that which gains for them\n \nhonour\n \nand\n \nglory\n \n, making it their own, keeping hold of it with their teeth as it were, and not letting it go in the least. For if in the case of the\n \nclergy\n \nit be called an action contrary to reason to desert the people, and to go away from them to the contest in the\n \ncause\n \nof\n \npiety\n \n; how much more contrary to reason shall it be judged for a\n \nbishop\n \nto desert his people, not in order that he may contend in a contest, but that he may deliver himself up to ease and indolence, and lay aside and escape entirely from his cares for the\n \nsalvation\n \nof\n \nsouls\n \n? The sixteenth canon also of the Seventh Oecumenical Council  gravely accuses those of folly who decree that the dignity of the sacred ministry can be retained by a\n \nbishop\n \nwho has repudiated his\n \nbishopric\n \n. For if according to the sentence of the aforesaid canon, a\n \nbishop\n \nwho has been absent from his See more than six months, unless some one of the causes there enumerated shall have intervened, has both fallen from the\n \nepiscopate\n \nand the highest dignity of the\n \npriesthood\n \n, and is deprived of both; how shall he who has repudiated the\n \nepiscopate\n \n, and refuses any longer to feed the flock entrusted to him, and despises the care of it through his desire of an easy life, be held to be of the number of\n \nbishops\n \n? For if he who has committed the lesser fault, of leaving for more than six months the people placed under him destitute of the care and administration of a pastor, incurs the privation of the\n \nepiscopate\n \nand of his sacred dignity; he who offends in a way greater and much more grievous, namely, in deserting altogether the multitude which the\n \ngrace\n \nof the\n \nHoly Spirit\n \nhas committed to him to be cared for and guarded, shall deservedly be punished with greater severity, and will pay the heavier penalty of losing, as far as he is concerned, the flock of which he was appointed shepherd by the great and chief Shepherd and High Priest. But those who decree the dignity of the\n \npriesthood\n \nto him as a reward and\nhonorarium\nfor declining his office, in my opinion make both themselves and him obnoxious to the judgment of\n \nGod\n \n."
